tracker_project
===============

A simple Django project to report and track geo-located incidents within certain areas of interest. Whenever a new incident occurs the user is reported in real-time and the event is marked in a map (using `Google Maps JavaScript API <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/>`_). It's is possible to report the locations manually, but there's also a view that uses the `geolocator <https://github.com/onury/geolocator>`_ library to automatically detect the user's location.

This project created to demonstrate how to use `GeoDjango <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/contrib/gis/>`_ and send real-time notifications using `NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/>`_ and `RabbitMQ <http://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_. For an in depth description of the project see the following `blogpost <http://www.machinalis.com/blog/rt-notifications-gevent-gis/>`_.

The default configuration uses `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ with the `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`_ extensions as database back-end, but it can also work with other GeoDjango compatible databases like `SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/>`_ + `SpatiaLite <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index>`_.

Requirements
============

Before you can run this project, the following packages need to be installed:

Ubuntu
------

* python-dev
* postgresql
* postgresql-server-dev-all
* postgis
* python-virtualenv
* libevent-dev
* rabbitmq-server

Fedora
------

* python-devel
* postgresql-server
* libpqxx-devel
* postgis
* python-virtualenv
* libevent-devel
* rabbitmq-server

Installation
============

Clone the repository: ::

    $ git clone git@github.com:abarto/tracker-project.git#node_js

Create and activate the virtual environment: ::

    $ cd tracker-project/
    $ virtualenv venv/
    $ . venv/bin/activate

Install the requirements: ::

    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Initialize nodeenv, and install bower: ::

    (venv)$ nodeenv -p
    (venv)$ npm install -g bower
    (venv)$ npm install -g socket.io
    (venv)$ npm install -g cookie
    (venv)$ npm install -g amqp
    (venv)$ npm install -g node-uuid

Create the database and the database user, install the PostGIS extensions: ::

    $ sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# CREATE ROLE tracker_project LOGIN PASSWORD 'tracker_project' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION;
    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE tracker_project WITH OWNER = tracker_project;
    postgres=# \connect tracker_project;
    postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

Initialize the database and set-up the Django environment: ::

    (venv)$ cd tracker_project/
    (venv)$ python ./manage.py migrate
    (venv)$ python ./manage.py bower_install

Running the development server
==============================

Before the django application can be run, we need to run the Node.js notifications application that will serve the socket.io client and send any messages received from the notifications AMQP queue to the client's socket.

    (venv)$ node ../tracker_project_js/notifications.js

At this point it is possible to run the development server using the runserver management command ::

    (venv)$ python ./manage.py runserver

If you want to run in it in a production environment. Follow the instructions of the next section.

Running the application
=======================

As mentioned in the previous section, you first need to run the Node.js application::

    venv)$ node ../tracker_project_js/notifications.js

The Django application itself can be run using `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`_: ::

    (venv)$ gunicorn --bind=localhost:8000 --workers=8 --name=tracker_project tracker_project.wsgi

Please notice that the application won't server the static files, so before you can start using it, you need to run the ``collectstatic`` management command: ::

    (venv)$ python ./manage.py collectstatic

and then use a regular HTTP server like `nginx <http://nginx.com>`_ (we've included a sample configuration file) to server the files.

You can also use socket and process managers like `Circus <https://chaussette.readthedocs.org/en/1.2/#using-chaussette-in-circus>`_ or `Supervisor <https://chaussette.readthedocs.org/en/1.2/#using-chaussette-in-supervisor>`_.

================

The basic architecture for the notifications system follows the guidelines presented by Jeremy West in the blogpost `Django, Gevent, and Socket.io <http://www.pixeldonor.com/2014/jan/10/django-gevent-and-socketio/>`_. We also used the code for his `socketio_runserver <https://github.com/iamjem/socketio_runserver>`_ management command.
